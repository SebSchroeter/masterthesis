This is the Repo for my Master- Thesis Project
"The Role of Voting Weights and Voting Power for the Formation of Coalition Governments"

Abstract: 
This master thesis examines the inuence of voting weights and power indices for
coalition governments, especially for the distribution of ministries. To do so it con-
siders national parliaments as examples of weighted voting games. The economic
literature predicts weights rather than seat shares to express the relative strength of
parties but previous studies show that ministries are distributed according to seat
contributions of government parties.
I replicate the results of Ansolabehere et al. (2005) with a more recent and com-
prehensive dataset but identify weaknesses in their assumptions and data. Drawing
from related non-cooperative models of bargaining, I develop a model which does
not require observing government parties but which allows to predict payos in form
of cabinet shares ex post, that is after the prime minister was made public but before
the government coalition formed. I further test how far cooperative power indices
act as predictors of partiesÂ´ payos and whether dierences in predictive power are
identiable.
This thesis presents arguments that both, voting weights and seat shares, play a
role in explaining coalition governments. The former identify parties which can
never expect to join the government but the latter express the nuances of bargaining
positions better. The power indices allow to explain a large share of observed cab-
inets purely from seats shares and surprisingly the Shapley-Shubik index performs
veriably better here than the Penrose-Banzhaf-Coleman index.

The data is taken from the Political Data Yearbook (https://politicaldatayearbook.com/)
and can be replicated using the jupyter notebooks. 
The regression results and graphs can be replicated using the data in the r_data folder. 
The other folders contain the intermediate calculations per country.
