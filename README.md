This is the Repo for my Master- Thesis Project

The code is currently being build and changed rapidly

The aim is first to create a efficient and simple to use pipeline from a distribution of party seats in a parliament to a Minimal Integer Representation of that Parliament.

Additional functionality included later: 
  Empirical Analysis 
  Different Power Measures 
  Graphical Tools
